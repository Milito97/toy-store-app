Description: This program is used to keep inventory in a toy store. You can look up toys to purchase, add toys, and
delete toys. 

Useage: This program can be opened from the runnable JAR file, or launched from your IDE. 

Three tabs will be visable, from the home option you can search for a toy using a name, serial number or search by type of type, this can be controlled using the radio sliders. Once a toy has been searched and selected, the user can choose to buy the toy if there is remaining inventory

Under the second tab, add, we can create a new entry for our database by selecting the type of toy and its assoicated values. The fields: serial number, name, brand, price, available count, and age-appropriate will be needed for each toy. There will also be additional fields to fill out depending on the type of toy selected. Warning messages will popup to assist the user.

Under the final tab, by entering a serial number we can search the database to find a match which can be selected and removed from our database.
